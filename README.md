## The **home** page is the portfolio page which has links to the following pages:
1. __About me__: a page contains my name, education, skills and background.
2. __My Blog__
3. __Projects__: _links_ for my projects with a brief _description_ about them.
4. __contact me__


## work in progress
Only the home page is not *adjustable* yet for a phone screen, as it has shapes drawn on it, I am still learning how to adjust it when there are Geometrical shapes drawn with HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.

## Support and contact details
 Please email me if there are any issues I can help fixing at: aya.osama90@gmail.com



## Languages Used
I used *HTML*, *CSS*, *Bootstrap* and *Java Script* to make my portfolio.
