              <p class="regular-txt">I finished my undergrad in computer engineering from the Islamic University of Gaza(IUG) in Palestine on Jan, 2013.</p>
              <p class="regular-txt">Unfortunately, I didn't have the chance to work or to get experience due to my
                 "spouse visa" which has not allowed me to work or to study.
                 But I was able to attend some of the Computer Engineering department's classes as
                 an auditing student at Texas A&M University to get more knowledge during these years.</p>
              <p class="regular-txt">My visa has just <em>changed</em>, so I felt like
                emgaging myself to the field again.</p>
              <p class="regular-txt">I am looking forword to start a master program in computer science.</p>
