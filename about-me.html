                <li>This is a good start up for me to engage in a working environment.</li>
                <li>The curriculum that epicodus provides is so strong, and I felt I can rely on with some more research
                    to get a good knowledge of HTML, CSS and Java Script</li>
                <li>The idea of self learning during the class is a new thing that I had not experienced before,
                    and it is exciting to go through this new expeeience.</li>
                <li>Also the experience of working with pairs is a good start for more engaging with different people
                    in the working environment.</li>
                <li>Making my own project after few weeks of the class is good push to working harder.</li>
                <li>And the most exciting this is the <em><strong>internship</strong></em>. Getting the chance to
                    work after six years of strugilling is a thing that I am looking forword to do, and can't wait.</li>

                <li>Learning new stuff has been always exciting,

                <li>I know that I am a good writer, at least in my native language.</li>
